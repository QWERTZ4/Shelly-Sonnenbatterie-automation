Shelly script for Sonnenbatterie 10 Solar Charging

The baic Idea is that you can connect a Shelly plus device to a Electric Vehicle Charger like the Vestel EVC04 that has the ability to be controlled via a dry contact. The Shelly is programmed with this script and opens and closes its relais according to the availability of Solar Power. The shelly connects to the Sonnenbatterie 10, in my case, via its API, so both devices have to be connected to the same local Network. You will alo need:
-the IP Adress of the Sonnenbaterie
-the API Authentication Token of the Sonnenbatterie found in the Software-integration menu of the Sonnenbatteries Web surface (enter the IP Adress in a browser and use the USER profile to log in)
